   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Indeed Web Scrapper's documentation!
===============================================
This package can be used to scrape job postings from Indeed.com. Moreover, a cli user interface is provided
to enter query parameters to search for a job, and the results are displayed and can be exported to a .csv file.
This package uses beautifulsoup4 4.9.1 and requests 2.24.0. In addition, I recommend using Python 3.6+.
